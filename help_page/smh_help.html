            <h2>Video tutorial</h2>
            <p>Coming soon</p>

            <h2>How things basically work</h2>
            <p>
                Before we dive into details, let's go through how the tool basically works. When you open the SMH menu, you'll notice
                the white vertical lines going in a row from left to right. This is the timeline. The white lines are representing frames.
                The white rectangle with a black outline is the playhead, which can be used to cycle through our frames.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you select an entity and drag the playhead around, nothing happens. This is because the timeline has no
                recorded frames. Recorded frames are where a recorded state of the entity is stored. They are represented as
                green rectangles in the timeline, and they can be moved, copied and removed. When the playhead is moved on
                top of a recorded frame, the recorded state will be applied to the entity, and when the playhead is between two
                recorded frames, the entity's state will be tweened between them.
            </p>

            <h2>Opening the menu</h2>
            <p>
                The menu is opened using the <i>+smh_menu</i> console command. If you don't know how to access the console,
                there are plenty of tutorials available showing you how to do so, so google up! Now, bind a key to the command, using
                <i>bind &lt;key&gt; +smh_menu</i>. The menu will open when you hold down your bound key.
            </p>

            <h2>Selecting an entity</h2>
            <p>
                Before we can record frames, we need to tell SMH what entity we want to animate. An entity can be selected by right clicking
                objects on the screen while the SMH menu is open. When an entity is glowing with a green outline, that entity is currently selected.
            </p>

            <h2>Moving the playhead</h2>
            <p>
                You can simply left click and hold the playhead rectangle to drag it on the timeline. You can also bind keys to <i>smh_next</i> and
                <i>smh_previous</i> commands, so you won't have to use the menu all the time.
            </p>

            <h2>Recording frames</h2>
            <p>
                Move the playhead to the position in the timeline where you want to record your frame. Then simply press the record button on the right.
                You can also bind a key to <i>smh_record</i> command, which has the same function as the record button, for easier access.
            </p>

            <h2>Managing recorded frames</h2>
            <p>
                After a recorded frame has been created, it is shown as a green rectangle in the timeline. You can click and hold the rectangle with your left
                mouse button to move the frame to another position. You can remove the frame by right clicking the rectangle. You can click and hold it with
                your middle mouse button to make a copy of the frame to another position. Copying can also be done by holding down Ctrl and right clicking.
            </p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Moving a frame on top of another frame will remove the frame that is not being moved. Be careful.</p>

            <h2>Adding or reducing frames</h2>
            <p>
                By default, the timeline is 100 frames long. This can be changed from the "Frame count" input. Frame count determines the amount of frames
                visible on the timeline as well as playback and rendering, which we will discuss below.
            </p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If recorded frames go outside your frame count, they are not removed. They just won't be visible in the timeline.</p>

            <h2>Animation playback</h2>
            <p>
                To preview your current scene, you can bind <i>+smh_playback</i> command to a key and hold it down. This will play the animation from
                frame 0 to your frame count with the framerate specified in the <i>Framerate</i> input. Note that previewing your animation with this
                might not give an accurate display of the final animation. There may be slight lagging that will not be present when rendering the animation
                into images.
            </p>

            <h2>Rendering</h2>
            <p>
                You can render your animation by simply using a camera and cycling through all of the frames and take pictures. However, this gets very
                repetitive and takes time. SMH has the <i>smh_makejpeg</i> command, which automates this tedious task for you! Simply bind it to a key,
                set up your camera and stuff, and fire away. After the rendering is complete, the resulted images are found in your local steam screenshots.
            </p>

            <h2>Saving</h2>
            <p>
                You might want to continue animating later, or save your finished scene, just in case you want to come back and change things. You can
                save your scene using the save menu found in the SMH menu. In the save menu, you give it a unique name, or overwrite one of the existing
                saves, and then hit the save button. And you scene is saved!
            </p>

            <h2>Loading</h2>
            <p>
                When you want to load your saved frames, you will need to do this individually for all entities. When you have selected an entity with SMH,
                open the load menu. Select your previously saved scene. You will then see a list of saved entities, identified by their model name. Select
                the right entity and then hit load, and the entity should now have all the frames that were saved.
            </p>

            <h2>Backing up saves</h2>
            <p>
                All saves are located in <i>garrysmod/data/smh</i>, so you can back up your saved scenes from there, or move scenes to somewhere
                else if they take up space in the save list.
            </p>

            <h2>Quicksave</h2>
            <p>
                It's always good practice to frequently save your scene, as there are many unexpected things that can happen. Garry's mod might crash,
                SMH might error out, your computer may crash or you have to lock down your house in case of a zombie apocalypse. Saving your scene
                manually might not be the most ideal thing to do. That's why there's the <i>smh_quicksave</i> command. Bind a key into this command and
                your scene will be saved with the name <i>quicksave</i> when you press it.
            </p>
